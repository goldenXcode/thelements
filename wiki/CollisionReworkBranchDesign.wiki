==Arrays==
Global arrays.

{{{
heat[TPoints]; //0-10, changes based on atmospheric heat and collisions
fallspeed[TPoints/TElements?]; //Overall fall speed = fallspeed[e]*atmosphereGrav
life[TPoints/TElements?]; //Frames before element deletion (possibly not needed)
state[TElements]; //0=solid, 1=liquid, 2=gas
special[TElements]; //Indexed special effects occurring every frame
specialval[TPoints]; //The value per point that is possibly used in special effects
density[TElements]; //0-10, density of the element

//Self explanatory
xvel[TPoints];
yvel[TPoints];
x[TPoints];
y[TPoints];

//An array of all pixels
allcoords[width][height];

//Predefined collision array
collisions[TElements][TElements];
}}}

==Atmosphere==
Defines the environment in which the reactions take place. Stored in a file with a .atm extension. Can be selected during play.

{{{
heat; //The temperature of the surroundings
gravity; //-1 - 1, the multiplier for fall speed
walled; //Whether elements can fall through the edges or not
name; //The name given to the atmosphere
}}}

==Custom Elements==
Users can create custom elements and save them to files with .ele extensions, to be loaded dynamically at runtime (and also downloaded, emailed, etc).
