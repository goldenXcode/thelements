Add any of your original artwork to the "Art" section along with a unique name, and a description of where you want it to go. Vote on the artwork in the "Vote" section. Add your email address under the name of the image, so that nobody can spam votes. We still need to figure out a more official voting system.

Newart:

Ryan - I think it's a bit too blue, I would prefer a more white or black theme, I like the bottom IDKJava logo though.  I'm impressed with the simulator though.

Dan - The artwork is good but I'm not sure it fits this program. The backround looks more like a fractal than what occurs in the game. Some rounding of the corners on the buttons and button shading would also be nice.
Just an opinion
