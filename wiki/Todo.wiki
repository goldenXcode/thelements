= Introduction =

This is a list of things we would like to accomplish for this application.  Don't edit this unless you are a project member.  Suggestions go on the Requests page.

= Programming =

*CURRENT - Fix up optimization code. Clean up code too.*

-Add in optimization for collision calculation.  Particles should be put into frozen mode and not calculated if they have been inactive for 10 frames in a row ( this could also be optimized ).  Unfreeze any particles around a particle that has changed state, by either moving or any other action.  This should avoid unnecessary collision calculation.

-Sort unfrozen particles each frame by their Y position to avoid unnecessary collisions while particles are falling. 

-Add in the option to edit any element, not just custom element.

-Add in the option to use sliders to change the background color.

-Add in black-holes.

-Finish adding in server functionality

= Art =

-Make new button for eraser, the "X" is unclear that it is the eraser.

-Create button images for main menu.

= Other =

-Raise enough money to buy a server to host save uploading and downloading

-Create new backgrounds for main menu and loading.
