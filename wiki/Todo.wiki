*CURRENT - Bug fixing*

-Add in optimization for collision calculation.  Particles should be put into frozen mode and not calculated if they have been inactive for 10 frames in a row ( this could also be optimized ).  Unfreeze any particles around a particle that has changed state, by either moving or any other action.  This should avoid unnecessary collision calculation.
-Sort unfrozen particles each frame by their Y position to avoid unnecessary collisions while particles are falling. 
-Add in the option to edit any element, not just custom element.
-Add in the option to use sliders to change the background color.
-Add in black-holes.
-Finish adding in server functionality

-Fix any bugs in the Issues section

GL Texture fix: in nativeInit, find textureWidth and textureHeight based on power of two higher than screenWidth and screenHeight. Create a blank texture based on this. In nativeResize, use glTexSubImage2D to replace the portion that is workWidth by workHeight. Draw only that portion on the triangles using texture coords.
