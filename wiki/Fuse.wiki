#summary This is a help file for the Fuse element.

= Fuse =

Fuses are generally used to create a timed explosion. To create a fuse, simply pick it from the element selector and draw it like you would a [Wall]. Fuses are obviously very flammable and when they come into contact with [Magma] or [Fire] they will begin to to burn up. As a fuse burns, it will create a little bit of [Fire]. To get the most fun out of your fuse, try connecting one end to [C4] or C4++ and then ignite the other end.
