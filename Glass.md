# Glass #

Glass can be created in two different ways. First you can simply place glass on the the screen where ever you like with the element selector. When you place glass it will not move. The other method is to create it by allowing [Sand](Sand.md) to come into contact with [Magma](Magma.md) or [Fire](Fire.md).
