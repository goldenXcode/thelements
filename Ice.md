# ICE #

Ice is the frozen state of [Water](Water.md). Ice does not move when it is placed on the screen. Ice can be melted into [Water](Water.md) by [Salt](Salt.md), [SaltWater](SaltWater.md), [Magma](Magma.md), and [Fire](Fire.md). The latter two also create [Steam](Steam.md) during the process. When Ice touches [Water](Water.md) it will turn it into more ice.
