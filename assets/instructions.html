		<h1>How to Play The Elements</h1><br />
		<h2>The Basics</h2><br />
		The Elements is a sandbox type game, meaning there is no objective, you just play around with the elements and explore the interactions between them. 
		To place elements on the screen, simply touch within the work area. That's all there is to it! For a more detailed guide on all the different tools, read on...<br /><br />
		<h2>The Tools</h2><br />
		There are two different modes for this game: ui and non-ui. The game automatically starts out with the ui enabled, however you can toggle between ui and non-ui in the preferences screen. 
		Read about how to get to the preferences screen in the Menu section.<br />
		<h3>UI</h3>
		First, lets take a look at the ui mode. There are two bars, one at the top, and one at the bottom. The top bar contains the following tools in order: 
		Eraser, Play/Pause, Save, Load, Load Demo, and Exit. Both the Eraser button and Play/Pause button are toggle buttons, meaning they toggle between two states. 
		When you press the eraser button, the selected element is switched to eraser and the current element is saved. When you press it again, the selected element 
		switches back to the saved element. When you press the Play/Pause button, it switches to pause, so that the elements stop falling and reacting. Once pressed again 
		it switches back to play mode, and the elements continue interacting and falling. The other four buttons are self explanatory, and simply do what the name suggests. <br /><br />
		The bottom bar has only two objects: the Palette and the Brush Size Slider. The palette button brings up a menu to select an element. The Brush Size Slider is used to set the brush size 
		ranging from a radius of 1 to a radius of 32.<br />
		<h3>Non-UI</h3>
		The other mode is the non-ui mode. This mode is much simpler than the ui mode, but does take a little longer to access the tools. In non-ui mode, the entire screen is devoted to the work area, 
		giving you a little extra room to work, with less clutter. However, you still have access to all the same tools via the menu.<br /><br />
		<h2>The Menu</h2>
		When in non-ui mode, all of the tools normally in the two bars are moved into the options menu. In ui mode, only a few tools that were not included in the bars were kept in the options 
		menu. In order to access the options menu, simply press the menu button. The three options not incorporated in the ui mode are: Clear Screen, Toggle Size, and Preferences. Clear Screen simply clears the screen, 
		Toggle Size toggles between zoomed out (which runs slower) and zoomed in (the default that runs faster), and Preferences, which will be discussed in the next section.<br /><br />
		<h2>Preferences</h2>
		Preferences allow you to customize Element Works to best suit you. The following options are included: background color, flip screen, and toggle ui. Background color allows you to switch between a white and black background. 
		Flip screen should only be used if nothing shows up when you try to draw. This is known to occur on the <b>HTC Tattoo</b>. Toggle ui toggles whether you are in ui-mode or non-ui-mode.
