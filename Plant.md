# Plant #

Plant is the only living particle in the game. It doesn't technically move but there's a twist. Whenever it comes into contact with [Water](Water.md), it will grow and turn the [Water](Water.md) into plant. Depending on what you're trying to accomplish, this chain reaction can have drastic effects on your ecosystem. One little plant particle can wipe out a lake. It can even grow upwards when under a [Water](Water.md) fall. Fortunately, plant is also highly flammable. It's only takes a little [Fire](Fire.md) or [Magma](Magma.md) to eat up large areas of plant growth, leaving nothing. Plant also has a weakness for [Salt](Salt.md) and [SaltWater](SaltWater.md). When it comes into contact with these, it will die and leave behind [Sand](Sand.md).
