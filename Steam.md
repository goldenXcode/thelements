# Steam #

When [Water](Water.md) gets to hot it turns into [Steam](Steam.md) and begins to rise. This occurs when [Water](Water.md) comes into contact with [Fire](Fire.md) or [Magma](Magma.md). [Steam](Steam.md) always rises. Steam will eventually begin to cool and turn back into [Water](Water.md).
